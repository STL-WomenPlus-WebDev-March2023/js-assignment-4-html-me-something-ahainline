            <p>Shortly after announcements closing both of our offices and extensions of the work from home orders, we decide to adopt a kitten.</p>
            <p>I found a tabby calico mix on <a href="https://petfinder.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">petfinder</a> who we adopt from  <a href="https://bahspets.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belleville Area Humane Society</a> and name Pixel. She quickly makes herself at home.</p>
